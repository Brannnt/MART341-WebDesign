        Educated at Marlborough Grammar School, where his father taught, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, Golding
        graduated in 1935. After working in a settlement house and in small theatre companies, he became a schoolmaster
        at Bishop Wordsworth’s School, Salisbury. He joined the Royal Navy in 1940, took part in the action that saw the
        sinking of the German battleship Bismarck, and commanded a rocket-launching craft during the invasion of France
        in 1944. After the war he resumed teaching at Bishop Wordsworth’s until 1961.
