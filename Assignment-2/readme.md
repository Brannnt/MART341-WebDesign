How to go to sleep in 3 steps!
* Make your bed.
    - You need a bed in order to sleep well.
* Sing a lullaby.
    - [*Rock-A-Bye-Baby*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3i54sJj5IY) works for me.
* Get in bed and think about sheep.
    - Make sure they aren't scary sheep.

You *should* be sleeping by now. 
If not, try setting your awake levels to zero like this.
```javascript
var awake = 0;
```
