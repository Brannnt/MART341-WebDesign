1. Browsers are made up of different components that work together. The interface is what the browser shows to the user, the browser engine interprets the html and css code of the website, and the rendering engine translates the javascript from the browser engine to the inface. The network is also needed for the browser to grab the content needed for the page such as html and css files.

2. The dom is the interface to html. It makes needed changes to the html document in order for it to be used by multiple programs. It is also the first thing on the render tree, since the html file needs to be primed for use by the later things on the tree.

3. HTML is the first rendition and it is the most user friendly. It also has a greater range of use by devices. XML is similar to HTML but it is able to refresh data without the page being refreshed. However, it doenst render anything like HTML does. XHTML is a combonation of both HTML and XML. It makes sure documents are written correctly and is almost identical to HTML. However, it is harder to code with since it has stricter coding regulations than the other two.
